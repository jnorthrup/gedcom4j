2 CONT 
2 CONT Written by Samuel Pedley	
2 CONT My grandfather, Richard Pedley, was a Cheshire farmer, born in 1800 in the village of Barthom
2 CONC ley near Crewe. On leaving Bridge House Farm, (the ancestral home since 1712) to get married
2 CONC , he took a farm "Hall o’the Heath" Haslington, where he had a family of ten children; four S
2 CONC ons and six daughters. He was a man of fine physique, six feet four and a half inches in heig
2 CONC ht. He attended the village church (C of E) Barthomley, where, in the grave-yard, the famil
2 CONC y tombstone of the Pedleys dates back to 1772. The church may be reckoned among the handsom
2 CONC e churches in Cheshire. My grandfather became troubled at the religious ignorance of the vill
2 CONC age peasantry and their neglected condition in those days. He started tract distributing an
2 CONC d preaching in the open air and the people gathered to hear him. After study of the New Testa
2 CONC ment, he came to the belief, held by Baptists, of confession of faith before baptism. At a vi
2 CONC llage, Wheelock Heath (about three miles away) there was a small Free Church building, erecte
2 CONC d in 1704, where Presbyterians and Congregationalists worshipped. Here the Rev. Matthew Henry
2 CONC , the well-known Biblical commentator, ordained the first minister in 1706. In my grandfather
2 CONC ’s time it was used for preaching and worship on Sundays once a fortnight. By a friendly arra
2 CONC ngement a new Trust Deed was granted and a Baptist Church started in this old brick-walled bu
2 CONC ilding with thatched roof. Here my grandfather acted as a lay minister for forty one years, w
2 CONC here the villagers and farmers gathered for worship on Sunday mornings and late afternoons. H
2 CONC e held dedication services for infant children. For a time until a baptistry was built, he ba
2 CONC ptised believers in an adjacent mere known as Winterley Pool, earning the name of ‘Pedley th
2 CONC e Dipper" from his fellow farmers in the district., Later he became one of the first temperan
2 CONC ce advocates in the north of England, he was present when the first train passed through Crew
2 CONC e in 1840 and made a temperance speech there to a large assembly from a railway goods wagon
2 CONC . My grandmother though a busy dairy farmer’s wife and mother, gave him her loyal support.	
2 CONT From the Baptist Times 18 November 1954	
2 CONT 
2 CONT 250th ANNIVERSARY OF WHEELOCK HEATH EAPTIST CHAPEL	
2 CONT A framed document hangs in the vestry giving a list of ministers over a period of 200 years f
2 CONC rom 1704 to 1904. One of these, Richard Pedley, held the pastorate for 41 years, his son cont
2 CONC inued in the ministry for 25 years. He was the great-grandson of an earlier minister, Corneli
2 CONC us Gregory, who ministered for 28 years. Thus grandfather, grandson and great- grandson serve
2 CONC d the church between them for 94 years. Surely it would be difficult to find a parallel to th
2 CONC is record in any part of the country. The average length of the pastorates during the first t
2 CONC wo centuries was 18 years. The present church was erected in 1860.

2 CONT BIOGRAPHY: FROM SAMUEL PEDLEY'S BIOGRAPHY
2 CONT My grandfather, Richard Pedley, was a Cheshire farmer, born in 1800 in the village or Barthom
2 CONC ley, near Crewe. On leaving Bridge House Farm, (the ancestral home since 1712) to get married
2 CONC , he took a farm near "Hall-o-the-Heath" where he had a ,
2 CONT family of ten children; four sons and six daughters.
2 CONT He was a man of fine physique, six feet four and a half inches in height.
2 CONT He attended the village church, Barthomley, where, in the grave-yard, the family tombstone o
2 CONC f the Pedleys dates back to1772.
2 CONT The church may be reckoned among the handsome churches in Cheshire, though not a large edific
2 CONC e. It is of several types of Gothic architecture. The chancel is the oldest part of it, proba
2 CONC bly erected about the reign of Edward I, 1300. On a corbel over the Crewe Chancel is the dat
2 CONC e 1589, when Elizabeth was queen.
2 CONT My grandfather became troubled at the religious ignorance of the village peasantry and thei
2 CONC r neglected condition in those days. He started tract dis­tributing and preaching in the ope
2 CONC n air, and the people gathered to hear him. After study of the New Testament, he came to th
2 CONC e belief, held by the Baptists, of confession of faith before baptism.
2 CONT At a village, Wheelock Heath (about three miles away) there was a small Free Church building
2 CONC , erected in 1704, where Presbyterians and Congregationalists worshipped. Here the Rev. Matth
2 CONC ew Henry, the well-known Biblical commentator, ordained the first Minister in 1706.
2 CONT At my grandfather's time it was used for preaching and worship on Sundays once a fortnight. B
2 CONC y a friendly arrangement a new Trust Deed was granted and a Baptist Church started in this ol
2 CONC d brick-walled building with thatched roof.
2 CONT Here my grandfather acted as lay minister for forty-one years, where the villagers and farmer
2 CONC s gathered for Worship on Sunday mornings and late afternoons.
2 CONT He held dedication services for infant children, for a time, until a Baptistery was built, an
2 CONC d he baptised believers in an adjacent small lake known as Winterley Pool, earning the name o
2 CONC f "Pedley the Dipper" from his fellow farmers in the district.
2 CONT Later, he became one of the first Temperance advocates in the North of England. My grandmothe
2 CONC r, though a busy dairy farmer's wife and mother, gave him her loyal support.

1 NOTE BIOGRAPHY: 
2 CONT A SHORT RESUME of my LIFE 1877 to 1935
2 CONT S. E. PEDLEY, M.R.C.S., etc.
2 CONT 
2 CONT I AFTER LEAVING SCHOOL 1879.
2 CONT After passing the Preliminary Medical Examination of the Royal College of Surgeons at sixtee
2 CONC n years of age, I left Boarding School at Margate and was in my father's Dental Laboratory fo
2 CONC r three years and nine months. I then entered the Royal Dental Hospital and Charing Cross Hos
2 CONC pital and obtained my L.D.S. R.C.S. in 1885, qualifying as a Dental Surgeon.
2 CONT In order to be near Railway Approach, London Bridge, and to assist in my father's practice
2 CONC , I joined Guy's Hospital, working for him whenever I could. In October 1888, I obtained my M
2 CONC edical and Surgical qualifications, L.R.C.P., M.R.C.S. 
2 CONT Earlier in that year my eldest sister, Mrs. Fenoulhet, returned from New Zealand, a widow, wi
2 CONC th three young children. I offered my parents to take the house next door, which was vacant
2 CONC , to provide a home for her so that she might be near her old home. On completing my examinat
2 CONC ions I started practice. My sister resided with me for some
2 CONT eighteen months; leaving me to live at Seaford in the year 1890 for the benefit of the sea ai
2 CONC r to her children and herself. My second sister, Sissie, then came to live with me, but owin
2 CONC g to attacks of asthma in the London fogs, she had to winter at Bournemouth with a relative.
2 CONT My mother's health, with her increasing years, was not good. Dr. Taylor, Physician of Guy's H
2 CONC ospital, on being consulted, advised residing out of London. Sutton was chosen, where my pare
2 CONC nts lived to ripe old age: my father to his eightieth year, and my mother to her ninetieth.
2 CONT As my practice was increasing, finding the house rather small, I purchased 18, Peckham Road
2 CONC , next door, on the other side of our old home. Previous to this, when I had reached the ag
2 CONC e of about 29 years, my thoughts turned to Medical Missionary work, in China.
2 CONT  
2 CONT In several spare afternoons and evenings a week I took up post-graduate work in Medical and S
2 CONC urgical courses, and later offered my services to the Baptist Missionary Society. I was accep
2 CONC ted and designated for the city of Sian-fu, in the province of Shensi, but first to spend tw
2 CONC o years with my friend, Dr. T. C. Paterson, at his hospital at Tsing-chow-fu
2 CONT in Shantumg, for acquaintance with the medical work and study of the language.
2 CONT Owing to an unexpected outbreak of mental illness in three members of the family, I had reluc
2 CONC tantly to withdraw my offer and face home duties. To help my dear parents, my youngest brothe
2 CONC r resided with me After several illnesses, he recovered: qualified as a Dental surgeon, takin
2 CONC g L.D.S. of Edinburgh where, unable to go myself, I sent him with a friend. Happily he passed
2 CONC , and afterwards married and engaged in practice for some twenty years at Tunbridge Wells. 
2 CONT My youngest sister did not recover, and my brother Stephen was never mentally strong again. 
2 CONT When I reached the age of 35, my thoughts turned to marriage, and a short resume of my marrie
2 CONC d life to Miss Ada E. Wolsey I now record.
2 CONT II
2 CONT MARRIED LIFE
2 CONT On March lst, 1899, I was married; my income was about £1,000 a year. I was living and practi
2 CONC sing at 18, Peckham Road, Camberwell, in a large old-fashioned house of about seventeen rooms
2 CONC , five of which (one partly) were used for professional purposes.
2 CONT The house was comfortably furnished, and there was a pleasant garden at the back with lawn an
2 CONC d summer house. It lay well back from the main road in front; with grass approaches, and shru
2 CONC bs on either side of the main pathway.  
2 CONT We went for a month's honeymoon to Torquay and later in the year vie had a trip to Scotland f
2 CONC or three weeks. 
2 CONT On January 1st, 1900, Eric was born. In the summer I sent his mother with him for two month
2 CONC s to Broadstairs. 
2 CONT On January 7th, 1901, Victor was born. On the approach of summer I sent the two children, wit
2 CONC h their mother and nurse, to Crowborough for two or three months, I travelling to and fro mos
2 CONC t days of the week. 
2 CONT The following year, 1902, I procured rooms at a small farmhouse near Dorking, where the mothe
2 CONC r and children, with nurse, stayed two or three months. 
2 CONT The following year, 1903, I rented roams at a small farmhouse at Hunters Forstal, near the Re
2 CONC culvers, Herne Bay, where the two children stayed with their mother and Nurse. 
2 CONT Clifford was born in July of that year and later formed one of the party with his mother an
2 CONC d nurse.
2 CONT I am mentioning these particulars as to summer changes as I found the winters told very badl
2 CONC y upon my wife's health; she suffering severe attacks of neuralgic headaches, following influ
2 CONC enza or catarrhal colds each winter.
2 CONT In 1904, I rented a furnished house at Westcott, near Dorking, where my wife, with the thre
2 CONC e children, stayed, I travelling to and fro from Camberwell.
2 CONT In January 1905, Cecil was born; for the health of their mother and the children, I rented an
2 CONC d furnished a seaside house at Whitstable, where they lived three or four months each summe
2 CONC r for four years. Gordon was born at Whitstable in 1906.
2 CONT With the five young boys and their mother not strong, I decided to get them out of London an
2 CONC d live in the country.
2 CONT During the spring and summer of 1907, at a cost of £1,000, I had the Camberwell house made in
2 CONC to flats (four), reserving one for the carrying on of the practice. By this I was able to ren
2 CONC t a house at Goddington Lane, Orpington, where we resided for six and a half years; giving u
2 CONC p the Whitstable house on entering our new home.
2 CONT The Railway service to Camberwell was not good under the old S. E. & London, Chatham & Dove
2 CONC r Railway, and involved some three hours a day travelling to and fro, with an extra walk of o
2 CONC ne mile from Orpington Station, often after a hard day's work. Here our two daughters, Doroth
2 CONC ea and Rachel, were born in 1907 and 1911. 
2 CONT In the spring of 1914 we moved to Hayesford, Hayes Lane, Bromley: for the better facilities o
2 CONC f education, the boys going to the County School and later, to Dulwich College. Here we live
2 CONC d some eleven years. 
2 CONT The house was an old farmhouse with a 1arge garden of some two acres, with orchard, kitchen a
2 CONC nd flower gardens, and tennis lawns. For country surroundings so near to London, the positio
2 CONC n was ideal. During the years 1912 and 1918, I gradually transferred my practice to the Wes
2 CONC t End, as Camber­well was changing so much from the residential to an industrial area. This e
2 CONC ntailed a great deal of strain and extra travelling. 
2 CONT For the sacrifice of living out of London, I was rewarded in the better health of my wife an
2 CONC d in the children developing healthy and good physiques, though, through an attack of maligna
2 CONC nt endo-carditis, we were bereaved of our beloved little Rachel, in her tenth year.  
2 CONT Eric joined me in the practice in 1923. Having purchased the necessary apparatus, I induced h
2 CONC im to take up Dental Radiography to occupy his time end gradually introduce him to my patient
2 CONC s. In October 1924, my health not being good, I consulted Dr. Young; Senior physician to Midd
2 CONC lesex Hospital. He warned me that I was over-working, that I should take more time off end li
2 CONC ve nearer to my practice. Acting partly on Dr. Young's advice, I found some benefit by sleepi
2 CONC ng several nights a week at Welbeck Street instead of travelling home to Bromley. 
2 CONT In December 1924, I consulted Mr. Eric Pearce Gould, a Surgeon on the staff of Middlesex Hosp
2 CONC ital. As a result of this consultation he informed me, after expert chemical examination of m
2 CONC y blood, that I was on the edge of a precipice and that a surgical operation was desirable wi
2 CONC thout much delay. 
2 CONT In February, 1925, I underwent a severe operation from which I made a good recovery, being aw
2 CONC ay from my practice for three months; my son, Eric, with the aid of' a qualified assistant, c
2 CONC arrying it on.
2 CONT It took another six months to complete restoration, though I was able to attend patients. A
2 CONC t the time none of the other boys were qualified, Victor passing his final L.D.S. later tha
2 CONC t year. 
2 CONT In September 1925, we removed from Bromley to the north west to London Bushey, Herts., to sav
2 CONC e railway travelling, and to motor to and from 43, Welbeck Street. In the winter months, th
2 CONC e thirty miles motoring to and fro, in the foggy weather, I found rather trying and often sta
2 CONC yed in town.
2 CONT I was able to purchase the freehold of the Poplars, Clay Hill, Bushey, where we resided som
2 CONC e eight years. Here Clifford. Gordon and Cecil attended their London Hospitals until qualifie
2 CONC d, Cecil joining Middlesex Hospital Medical School in 1926. Dorothea also received additiona
2 CONC l education in cooking, dressmaking, piano, singing and organ tuition.
2 CONT I must here record the assistance given by my own family when the three children, Gordon, Dor
2 CONC othea and Rachel were very young. My mother received Clifford and Cecil for some six months a
2 CONC t Sutton; my sister. Nellie, with Miss Thomas's aid, gave them every care and attention. Her
2 CONC e they attended school for two terms; (the two elder boys I sent to boarding school at Whitst
2 CONC able, and afterwards, as weekly boarders to Eltham College) before our removal to Bromley, th
2 CONC us giving relief to their mother at a time when it was most needed. 
2 CONT I am not unmindful of the attention given by Mrs. and Miss Wolsey, before or about that tim
2 CONC e when I took the Whitstable house, when my wife's headaches were very severe. 
2 CONT In 1933, having reached the age of 70, and with all the boys qualified. I felt I ought to red
2 CONC uce my expenses and if possible, live nearer my practice. Not being able to sell the Poplars
2 CONC , I let it for three years. Elm Cottage, in Watford (four miles further out) was chosen, I de
2 CONC ciding to live several nights in town. 
2 CONT Unfortunately, due to my past arduous life, with the extra travelling, I developed angina. I
2 CONC n May, 1934, after seeing a patient, I had a severe heart seizure a clot forming in my hear
2 CONC t muscle, and six weeks later one formed in my right lung from which I have made a partial re
2 CONC covery though my life was given up at the time.
2 CONT Thus, my active working days have ended, but not before four of the boys had qualified as Den
2 CONC tal Surgeons, the fifth as a Medical Practitioner, and my daughter happily married.
2 CONT After nearly fifty years of active practice, had I my time over again, I would endeavour to a
2 CONC ttend the meetings of the British Dental Association more. Unfortunately, practising in Sout
2 CONC h London for same eighteen years, and the full duties of family life, seemed to prevent my do
2 CONC ing so, though I have endeavoured to keep abreast of the times by reading and discussions wit
2 CONC h fellow practitioners,  and since 1923 my sons, attending the Dental Hospitals have freshene
2 CONC d me up.
2 CONT III
2 CONT EXTRA RESPONSIBILITIES DURING MY MARRIED LIFE
2 CONT Added to my family affairs, I became Co­-Executor and Trustee to three estates: my dear fathe
2 CONC r's, my father-in-law's Mr. J. Wolsey -and my brother's, Dr. T. F. Pedley, Who died suddenl
2 CONC y in Rangoon. The latter did not entail much of my time as my brother-in-law, Mr. R. J. Wilki
2 CONC nson, was in Rangoon at the time of his decease and I had only the administrative part at hom
2 CONC e to do in relation to his daughter and two sons.
2 CONT .
2 CONT My father died in December 1909; I and my brothers, Richard and George, were the Trustees . T
2 CONC he latter died suddenly , in April, 1911, leaving his widow and four children with little pro
2 CONC vision for the future. 
2 CONT Though not an Executor, I promised my brother George that I would do all I could to help, whe
2 CONC n he told me a few weeks before he died, how ill he was, and how small his finances were I wa
2 CONC s able, after considerable thought and much negotiation, with the consent of his widow, to bu
2 CONC y out of  my brother's small estate, his partner, who, being somewhat involved, could not pro
2 CONC vide the necessary capita1 to purchase the goodwill etc. of the practice outright; nor repa
2 CONC y to my brother's estate what he already owed for the share he had but recently acquired. 
2 CONT Then to install him as an assistant, with a salary equal to half the profits, giving him th
2 CONC e option of buying it within a certain period. My sister-in-law was to receive the other hal
2 CONC f of the profits, as well as the purchase money when paid. In return for doing all clerical w
2 CONC ork and attendance on patients, she and her family were to live in the house where the practi
2 CONC ce had been carried on. His solicitor drew up an agree­ment embodying these terms. Provisio
2 CONC n was thus made for herself and the children for some ten years or more. My brother Richard g
2 CONC enerously under took the school education of the only son, a boy of eleven.
2 CONT As regards my father's estate, he unfortunately, lent some £2,000 without security to a man w
2 CONC ho could never repay him. My brother Stephen, a seem-invalid, had a small annuity paid to hi
2 CONC m out of the estate, while provision had to be made far an invalid sister in a mental home, l
2 CONC eaving an income not sufficient to pay the annuity provided in the Will for my mother; also l
2 CONC eaving my two surviving sisters, who were the ultimate beneficiaries, without provision fro
2 CONC m the estate.
2 CONT To improve the income I took over the management of the house property, increasing the incom
2 CONC e by £60 to £70 per year. This I did for ten years. On my mother's death I handed it over t
2 CONC o a reliable agency. Here I must mention that my brother Richard not only visited his widowe
2 CONC d mother more than I could, but in the last few years of her life he generously helped her fi
2 CONC nancially, both of Which I was unable to do owing to distance and heavy family expenses.
2 CONT At my instigation a lawyer friend was consulted, who took Counsel's opinion on the Will. He f
2 CONC ound that the Will would allow capital out of the estate to be paid to the beneficiaries suff
2 CONC icient to meet their needs, they receiving it as part of their portion of the estate.
2 CONT Happily some book debts, and the winding up of a Building Society in which I acted as a Co-Di
2 CONC rector in place of my father, (involving my journeying to and from the Borough S .E., near Lo
2 CONC ndon Bridge, on many occasions) supplied the necessary funds.
2 CONT In 1913 my father-in-law died, leaving a small estate heavily mortgaged, and a Bank overdraf
2 CONC t of nearly £2,000 by his son, my Co-Executor, totalling in all about £11,500. 
2 CONT Three months after Mr. J. Wolsey's decease, the heaviest mortgage of £5,000 on some Camberwel
2 CONC l and Peckham property, on being valued at £5,300, was threatened to foreclosure unless reduc
2 CONC ed by £l ,500. After considerable trouble and guarantees from myself and co-trustee of £500 e
2 CONC ach and a promise to pay off the rest out of income, this was agreed upon by the Solicitors t
2 CONC o the Mortgager. From this portion of the estate
2 CONT the widow and her daughter Florence received the income after paying mortgage interest and ot
2 CONC her charges.
2 CONT The London & County Bank Manager at Camberwell then pressed for the reduction of the Bank Loa
2 CONC ns, of over £6,000.This meant the disposal of some freehold ground rents, on property at Nunh
2 CONC ead valued at £4,600. I consulted my Architect and Surveyor. He examined the property and, fi
2 CONC nding it in a bad state of repair end held by several leaseholders, advised serving notices o
2 CONC f repairs, and offering the freeholds at the marketable value to them.
2 CONT This was done and a sum of £4,300 was realised which was paid to the Bank. I may say here, th
2 CONC at when I found the estate was so heavily mortgaged I declined to act as
2 CONT Trustee, but was persuaded to do so by my brother-­in-law promising to help me all he could
2 CONC . This promise was not fulfilled.
2 CONT Mrs. Wolsey died early in 1919 end her daughter Florence soon after. By careful management an
2 CONC d judicious selling of some of the property, all mortgages and loans were cleared off. My wif
2 CONC e now enjoys a good income from the remainder of the estate
2 CONT 
2 CONT IV RELIGIOUS LIFE AND  EXPERIENCE
2 CONT My grandfather, Richard Pedley, was a Cheshire farmer, born in 1800 in the village or Barthom
2 CONC ley, near Crewe. On leaving Bridge House Farm, (the ancestral home since 1712) to get married
2 CONC , he took a farm near "Hall-o-the-Heath" where he had a ,
2 CONT family of ten children; four sons and six daughters.
2 CONT He was a man of fine physique, six feet four and a half inches in height.
2 CONT He attended the village church, Barthomley, where, in the grave-yard, the family tombstone o
2 CONC f the Pedleys dates back to1772.
2 CONT The church may be reckoned among the handsome churches in Cheshire, though not a large edific
2 CONC e. It is of several types of Gothic architecture. The chancel is the oldest part of it, proba
2 CONC bly erected about the reign of Edward I, 1300. On a corbel over the Crewe Chancel is the dat
2 CONC e 1589, when Elizabeth was queen.
2 CONT My grandfather became troubled at the religious ignorance of the village peasantry and thei
2 CONC r neglected condition in those days. He started tract dis­tributing and preaching in the ope
2 CONC n air, and the people gathered to hear him. After study of the New Testament, he came to th
2 CONC e belief, held by the Baptists, of confession of faith before baptism.
2 CONT At a village, Wheelock Heath (about three miles away) there was a small Free Church building
2 CONC , erected in 1704, where Presbyterians and Congregationalists worshipped. Here the Rev. Matth
2 CONC ew Henry, the well-known Biblical commentator, ordained the first Minister in 1706. 
2 CONT At my grandfather's time it was used for preaching and worship on Sundays once a fortnight. B
2 CONC y a friendly arrangement a new Trust Deed was granted and a Baptist Church started in this ol
2 CONC d brick-walled building with thatched roof. 
2 CONT Here my grandfather acted as lay minister for forty-one years, where the villagers and farmer
2 CONC s gathered for Worship on Sunday mornings and late afternoons. 
2 CONT He held dedication services for infant children, for a time, until a Baptistery was built, an
2 CONC d he baptised believers in an adjacent small lake known as Winterley Pool, earning the name o
2 CONC f "Pedley the Dipper" from his fellow farmers in the district. 
2 CONT Later, he became one of the first Temperance advocates in the North of England. My grandmothe
2 CONC r, though a busy dairy farmer's wife and mother, gave him her loyal support.
2 CONT Of his four sons, the eldest and youngest emigrated to Australia, while Richard, the second s
2 CONC on, with his father's aid, developed the business of a Cheese Factory in Crewe, of which tow
2 CONC n he became twice Mayor, engaging there in public ser­vice. He was a lay preacher and tempera
2 CONC nce advocate and was made a Justice of the Peace.
2 CONT The third son, George, (my father) was apprenticed at the age of thirteen to a Chemist in San
2 CONC dbach, a neighbouring town, for five years. He came to London at the age of nineteen, in 1849
2 CONC . 
2 CONT Having received his early religious impressions in a godly home, on coming to London he thre
2 CONC w in his lot with Christian People, became a Bible Class teacher, Visitor of the Sick and a
2 CONC n active Temper­ance Worker.
2 CONT He had a situation as a Chemist's assistant in Fleet Street, close to Chancery Lane and old T
2 CONC emple Bar. He left this to start a small chemist's business in South London, (Southampton Str
2 CONC eet) where two of his sisters in turn kept house for him. 
2 CONT At the age of twenty-three, he married my dear mother, the only daughter of Mrs. Franklin
2 CONC , a widow. His business developed but, being mechani­cal, he turned to study Dentistry for wh
2 CONC ich there was much need. A friend gave him instruction in Vulcanine work, which was supersedi
2 CONC ng carving dentures out of bone and ivory. Through the intro­duction or a Christian friend, h
2 CONC e took rooms in High Street, Borough, Near London Bridge; disposed of his Chemist business an
2 CONC d built up a large and lucrative Dental practice.
2 CONT My parents had a family of eleven children, six sons and five daughters. I was the fifth son
2 CONC . I owe much, if not all, to the godly influence or my dear parents. At the age or thirteen
2 CONC , I was sent to a private school in Margate, where I stayed until I was sixteen years old.
2 CONT At the age or fourteen, I had an experience which I cannot forget though fifty-eight years ag
2 CONC o. I became dissatisfied with my life. I felt I was not what I ought to be. I was not a Chris
2 CONC tian and I determined to change. I sought the Lord Jesus Christ with all my heart and strengt
2 CONC h, realising that He alone, through God, would help me. One evening,
2 CONT when I felt I must give up, a great illumination lighted up my whole being. I felt a great
2 CONT sense of peace and happiness never before experienced. The Lord Jesus Christ seemed to
2 CONT possess me. Three evidences I think prove that some transformation had happened to me:
2 CONT (1) I had to tell my school fellows.
2 CONT (2) My conscience was quickened: telling lies, bad temper and selfishness
2 CONT made me unhappy.
2 CONT (3) A new sense of values was gained: unselfishness, love and consideration
2 CONT for others.
2 CONT Looking back, I feel I have often failed. Like Peter, I have followed afar off, (Mark XIV, 54
2 CONC ) and have even been tempted to deny Him. 
2 CONT Yet His attractive power, and His wonderful, loving look (Luke XXII, 51) have brought me back
2 CONC . Life's journey has been a perilous one, but He has been my Guide and Helper the whole of th
2 CONC e way so far. I vas baptised by immersion by the Rev. J. Drew, Baptist Minister at Margate, w
2 CONC hose church I joined, with my parents' consent, a few months later. 
2 CONT On leaving school, in 1879, I became a Sunday school Teacher, a Temperance Worker amongst th
2 CONC e young (known as the Band of Hope) and later, Treasurer and Secretary of the same Sunday sch
2 CONC ool. 
2 CONT About the year 1891 I was introduced by my sister, Nellie, to Dr. Dixon, the first Medical Mi
2 CONC ssionary in London, who was working, in connection  with the late Mr. John Wilkinson, "The Mi
2 CONC ldmay Mission to the Jews". 
2 CONT He told me that he was often badly in need of dental help in connection with his work. I offe
2 CONC red to go over one after­noon a week and see all the cases he could reserve for me: these wer
2 CONC e mostly cases of severe extractions. 
2 CONT For some time I took my Nitrous Oxide Gas apparatus with me and, with Dr. Dixon's help, man
2 CONC y sufferers were relieved, using an ordinary arm-chair to operate in. 
2 CONT The patients increased, and the work was so much appreciated that the supporters of the Missi
2 CONC on contributed to a dental outfit. Twenty to thirty patients would come in the afternoon; lit
2 CONC tle conservative work could be done. 
2 CONT The patients, mostly poor Russian and German Jews, came asking to have the "steam", which the
2 CONC y termed Nitrous Oxide Gas. Later a small charge was made to those who could afford it. I spe
2 CONC nt several happy years in association with Dr. Dixon, and had reluctantly to relinquish the a
2 CONC ppoint­ment on account of the claim of my increasing practice and family, finding a successo
2 CONC r before doing so.
2 CONT In 1897 I transferred my membership to Denmark Place, the late Dr. Stanford' s church. Her
2 CONC e I spent several happy years, becoming Bible Class Teacher, Co-superintendent of the Young P
2 CONC eople's Institute, and a Deacon. 
2 CONT On moving to Bromley, I joined the Congrega­tional Church under the ministry of the Rev. O. G
2 CONC . Whitfie1d, M. A., and was later elected a Deacon. Here I had many associations and friendsh
2 CONC ips and spent profitable years under the able ministry of its minister, with my family. 
2 CONT On moving to Bushey, from time to time I preached at the Primitive Methodist churches on  th
2 CONC e Watford circuit, which embraced the country districts around; also at the Baptist and Congr
2 CONC ega­tional churches in Leavesden and at Edgware. I have paid many visits to Cheshire and Shro
2 CONC pshire, taking the services at Waverton, Tarpor1ey, Beeston, Crewe, Haslington, and Wheeloc
2 CONC k  Heath.In Shrop­shire, at Wem and Frekton; and later, at Peace­haven, in Sussex.
2 CONT Whi1e I have always attended the worship of the Free Churches and am a Baptist in my beliefs
2 CONC , I have enjoyed much of the ministry of Congrega­tionalists and Presbyterians, as well as Ba
2 CONC ptists. 
2 CONT Any services I have rendered of an unselfish, self-sacrificing nature, have been prompted b
2 CONC y Him who came to minister, and not to be ministered to. 
2 CONT My total abstinence principles, practised all my life (with residence at Margate for three ye
2 CONC ars) I believe strengthened my constitution. While recognising the great work of the Church o
2 CONC f England, and remembering what we owe to her in the past -the cathedrals as centres of study
2 CONC , art, and seclusion in cathedral towns, in our cities and smaller towns -in villages and ham
2 CONC lets, there is still too much class distinction between Church and Free Church.
2 CONT One rejoices in the strong Evangelical section of the Church, whose desire is to break down t
2 CONC hese barriers to unity. 
2 CONT While I have not been able to accustom myself to the liturgical service, yet I have appreciat
2 CONC ed the dignity of worship practised by the Church of England; also by the Presby­terian and C
2 CONC ongregational Churches, which is absent in some of the Free Churches.
2 CONT To her authors, writers, published sermons, and addresses, I owe much teaching and freshnes
2 CONC s of thought, as well as spiritual upbuilding.

1 NOTE BIOGRAPHY: An abstract from "Journal of the Dental Association of South Africa" Volume 39, No
2 CONC . 1 January 1984; 
2 CONT Practitioners Corner - A personal record of dentistry, Clifford Edward Pedley
2 CONT When the Wright brothers built their flimsy biplane with its petrol engine and recorded the f
2 CONC irst power driven flight in November 1903, I was just four months old.
2 CONT Four score years have passed since then. Now millions of people travel by air each year, al
2 CONC l over the globe. Man has also travelled in outer space and visited the moon a number of time
2 CONC s. Numerous man-made satellites circle our world, performing important functions. Unmanned sp
2 CONC acecraft visit other planets, reporting their findings by amazing means. Space laboratories h
2 CONC ave been established. Recently a craft carried men into outer space and returned to be used a
2 CONC gain with complete success. Today we live in the fast moving, instant-communication world o
2 CONC f advanced technology and scientific discovery. Now the marvels of the microchip are with u
2 CONC s to herald who knows-what wonders for the future.
2 CONT In 1846, 57 years before that first powered flight and my birth, a boy of 16 -my grandfather
2 CONC , George Pedley walked to London from the family farm in Cheshire. He was to found a line o
2 CONC f dental surgeons to the present fourth generation. The purpose of this article is to relat
2 CONC e the history and development of the science and art of dentistry as I know it from the recor
2 CONC d of my grandfather and his four dental surgeon sons, from whom came five more dental surgeo
2 CONC n sons, three of whom were my brothers; and my personal memories of 43 years of dental practi
2 CONC se in three countries. I was the third son of Samuel Edward Pedley, who was the seventh son o
2 CONC f George Pedley.
2 CONT It was the beginning of the Victorian era. At the end of that long walk from Cheshire in 184
2 CONC 6 my grandfather, George, apprenticed himself to a pharmacist in Fleet Street, London, just a
2 CONC bove Ludgate Circus. How well I remember as a very small boy, with my father at my side, tha
2 CONC t chemist shop viewed from the top of a horse bus, behind the coachman; the traditional displ
2 CONC ay of two very large bottles -one filled with red, the other with green fluid. In bold gilt l
2 CONC ettering on the glass door were the words CHEMIST AND DENTIST. After the 1914-18 War it disap
2 CONC peared to give place to a "modern building" occupied by the "Daily Express". At the time my g
2 CONC randfather served his pharmaceutical apprenticeship there were no qualifications or degrees i
2 CONC n dentistry. Anyone could practise; chemists rendered an emergency service. Dental conservati
2 CONC on became George Pedley's special interest.
2 CONT Before his twenty-first birthday, rooms were rented in Newington Causeway and "GEORGE PEDLE
2 CONC Y DENTIST" appeared in polished brass plate on the door. Soon this courageous step was follow
2 CONC ed by the renting of extensive premises at Railway Approach, London Bridge, where he practise
2 CONC d for the rest of his life. When he was 21 he had married Rachel Franklin, who was proud of h
2 CONC er descent from America's famous son, Benjamin Franklin. She was only four feet six inches ta
2 CONC ll and bore George 14 children, three of whom died in infancy. George Pedley died in his slee
2 CONC p in his 80th year, having attended patients only the day before. Rachel died 10 years late
2 CONC r in her 90th year.
2 CONT Five of George's six sons went to London University and all of them became doctors and/or den
2 CONC tists. My father, Sam, obtained the MRCS, LRCP, London qualification at Guy's Hospital and th
2 CONC e LDS, RCS, Eng. at Charing Cross Hospital. The Royal College of Surgeons had instituted thei
2 CONC r diploma in dentistry, which could be acquired at the Charing Cross Hospital. Two years' stu
2 CONC dy at Charing Cross were required of a man holding a medical qualification before, followin
2 CONC g examination, he cold be granted the dental diploma. 
2 CONT Tom Pedley, the eldest son of George, obtained his MD at Charing Cross and was among the earl
2 CONC iest to obtain the RCS diploma in dentistry. Tom started his career as a ship's doctor on th
2 CONC e popular and busy P & 0 LINE of steamships plying to India. One day, when approaching the Po
2 CONC rt of Burma, Uncle Tom was stabbed in the neck by one of the passengers with delirium tremens
2 CONC . He recovered in hospital in Rangoon and stayed there to practise medicine for 44 years. H
2 CONC e became Colonel-in-Chief of the Indian Medical Corps and was awarded the Kaiser-I-Hind medal
2 CONC . In 1925, at age 73, he died while having an after-lunch nap on his surgery couch. When I ca
2 CONC me to Johannesburg in 1936, I was invited to call on a local medical practitioner, Dr Peacock
2 CONC . When he had satisfied himself that I was indeed a nephew of the late Colonel Tom Pedley, h
2 CONC e showed me a set of dental forceps Tom had given him when Dr Peacock served under him in th
2 CONC e I.M. Corps. I happened to know that this was a gesture my uncle liked to make to young MO'
2 CONC s who had pleased him. There were six or more forceps housed in a black leather folder.
2 CONT George's second son, Richard Denison Pedley, like my father qualified in medicine at Guy's an
2 CONC d dentistry at Charing Cross. He went on to obtain the FRCS of Edinburgh.
2 CONT At Guy's at the same time was Newland Pedley, a distant relative, who some years later founde
2 CONC d the Guy's Hospital Dental School and Hospital. Newland never married and left his substanti
2 CONC al Estate to Guy's. The Newland Pedley gold medal for operative dentistry is an award much va
2 CONC lued and sought after at Guy's. Professor Julius Staz, past Dean of the Oral and Dental Hospi
2 CONC tal of the University of the Witwatersrand and my contemporary, says that this award is one o
2 CONC f his most prized possessions.
2 CONT Denison Pedley joined his father George at Railway Approach, where he practised for the res
2 CONC t of his days. He died, aged 73, in 1931. In the 1890's he wrote a book which he illustrate
2 CONC d himself and which was published in England and America, titled THE HYGIENE OF THE MOUTH -
2 CONC A guide to the prevention and control of Dental Diseases. Full of wisdom and sound advice, th
2 CONC e book also exposed the appalling state of "the lower orders" of society of those days. I hav
2 CONC e donated a copy of the book to the Library of the University of the Witwatersrand's School o
2 CONC f Dentistry.
2 CONT After qualifying in medicine at Guy's, George's third son, also George, joined his brother To
2 CONC m in medical practice in Rangoon. Later he returned to obtain his LDS at Guy's and set up den
2 CONC tal practice in Winchester. He died aged 52. His son Kenneth's education was sponsored by Den
2 CONC ison Pedley, who sent him to Guy's, where he was my contemporary in studies, although not i
2 CONC n age. He had seen war service as a pilot in the RAF. I had been too young for military servi
2 CONC ce (I "did my bit" working on the land in Lincolnshire in my school holidays). I lost touch w
2 CONC ith Kenneth but, ten years later when I emigrated to South Africa in 1936, he took over my Lo
2 CONC ndon practice, dying in 1950 aged 58.
2 CONT At the age of 35 my father Sam, George's fifth son, had a well-established dental practice i
2 CONC n his fine home at 18 Peckham Road, Camberwell, London, SE. This was a fashionable neighbourh
2 CONC ood in those horse and carriage days. In 1898 Sam married Ada Wolsey, the lovely daughter o
2 CONC f the owner of an even finer house and garden -No. 15, immediately opposite. Ada, my mother
2 CONC , had been to finishing school in Belgium and on her return became one of the first student
2 CONC s of the now famous Camberwell Art School. Mother was an accomplished pianist and artist Sh
2 CONC e was also, through the example of her own gentle mother, well trained in the domestic arts
2 CONC .  One day, on her way to Art School, her upper right central tooth became the victim of a st
2 CONC one thrown at random by a street urchin. This led to a professional visit, and later marriage
2 CONC , to my father.
2 CONT A posted crown was fitted which was still there when she died aged 87. The method used was: g
2 CONC old post; platinum foil overstamped; crown cast gold to platinum pin porcelain facing.
2 CONT At this time father had started a "West End" connection and was renting a suite of rooms on t
2 CONC he top floor of Regent House, then a new and imposing building in Regent Street near Oxford C
2 CONC ircus.
2 CONT The building -some five storeys high -was completely lit by electricity and had a manually op
2 CONC erated lift which could be seen going up and down in the well of the spiral staircase It carr
2 CONC ied three or four people, including the operator who was not always there Passing verticall
2 CONC y through the far right-hand corner of the lift was a steel cable. With gloved hand the opera
2 CONC tor pulled the cable, causing the lift to move, braking it to a standstill at the desired flo
2 CONC or.
2 CONT This was a delight to adventurous youth, but I have always suspected that this was the main r
2 CONC eason for my father's move to 43 Welbeck Street in 1917.
2 CONT Getting back to the Camberwell home and dental practice: By 1907 father had acquired five son
2 CONC s of his own. He let his house (eventually dividing it into flats) and moved us all out t
2 CONC o a two-acre property on top of a hill in the country, "The Maples", in Orpington, Kent There
2 CONC , by 1911, two daughters were added to the family. In top hat and tails (black in winter, gre
2 CONC y in summer) with umbrella on arm, father always walked the mile and a half downhill to the O
2 CONC rpington railway station but, coming home tired at night, he would take one of the hansom cab
2 CONC s that were always lined up for hire at the station entrance.
2 CONT  
2 CONT On 1 April 1914 we moved to Bromley, Kent, only eight miles from London. There, in a large ma
2 CONC nor house on 5 acres of ground with surrounding farmlands, we lived for the next 11 years thr
2 CONC ough overflying Zeppelins and Gotha bombers of the great World War. I recall that that idylli
2 CONC c home, with its abundant orchards and kitchen garden, was leased to my father for £85 per an
2 CONC num.
2 CONT My eldest brother Eric, having qualified at the Royal Dental Hospital, joined father at 43 We
2 CONC lbeck Street in 1923. He set up as a dental radiologist and did well, since few dentists ha
2 CONC d acquired X-ray apparatus. In any case the machine was large and expensive and necessitate
2 CONC d installing a transformer which was both costly and noisy. A few more years had to pass befo
2 CONC re the West End's direct current electricity was changed to the now universally used alternat
2 CONC ing supply.
2 CONT Eric also performed a valuable service to my father as anaesthetist. It was at the end of ope
2 CONC rating for the removal of impacted teeth that Sam collapsed with a "stroke". Although he mad
2 CONC e a good recovery he did not practise again. He relapsed some 18 months later and died in 193
2 CONC 5 in his 73rd year.
2 CONT My career at one of England's famous public schools, Dulwich College, was undistinguished bu
2 CONC t enlivened by air raid warnings and bomb attacks. The bombs, which at first were hand-held a
2 CONC nd dropped over the sides of the planes, developed into huge lethal affairs, one of which, i
2 CONC n the dawn hours in May 1918, blew the imposing wrought-iron gates of the entrance to nearb
2 CONC y Dulwich Park sky-high, leaving a crater big enough (to me at the time) to bury a double sto
2 CONC rey bus.
2 CONT Armed with an honours certificate of the Royal College of Preceptors examining board (this wa
2 CONC s the initial requirement for medicine and dentistry in those days), I left Dulwich College t
2 CONC o join my father as a dental mechanic apprentice.
2 CONT This was the requirement of the Dental Board at that time. 1 was in fact one of the last trai
2 CONC ned under this regulation; thereafter, dental mechanics instruction became the prerogative o
2 CONC f the dental schools only.
2 CONT Of this period of introduction to my chosen profession I have many happy and interesting memo
2 CONC ries. The "war to end all wars" was over. Business was booming and the "newly rich" were als
2 CONC o around. Gold work in the laboratory abounded and Mr Tappin, a deaf-mute and unique personal
2 CONC ity, was an excellent teacher. I soon acquired skills in gold suaging, soldering and casting
2 CONC , although my artistic nature rebelled at the use of vulcanite (plastics were unknown) and fa
2 CONC lse-looking teeth made of opaque porcelain.
2 CONT One of my earliest laboratory duties was to make a stock of amalgam filings. The correct an
2 CONC d measured ingredients were melted in a crucible; father would then be called to contribute c
2 CONC lippings from a gold sovereign (these were still in use but not for long). When cold, I secur
2 CONC ed the almost fist-sized ingot under several thicknesses of newspaper in a vice. Then, wit
2 CONC h a file (which was considered almost sacred as it had been kept for years only for this expr
2 CONC ess purpose) I would, at convenient intervals over the following days, produce the required f
2 CONC ilings. 
2 CONT These would be spread out on a shelf to "age" before being bottled for use. Habit dies hard
2 CONC , but after this lot had been used up father was persuaded to buy his amalgam from the denta
2 CONC l depots.
2 CONT Another laboratory task I had to perform was the breaking up of father's considerable stock o
2 CONC f porcelain platinum pin teeth. Not only had the "Steels Facing", with its gold removable bac
2 CONC king, been recently introduced, but also gold-clad pinned porcelain teeth were generally in u
2 CONC se. What really prompted the exercise was the post-war price of platinum, which had soared t
2 CONC o a dizzy £25 an ounce. I seem to remember that gold was less than £3 an ounce.
2 CONT The laboratory was in the extensive basement of the three-storey building with surgeries on t
2 CONC he first and second floors. Next to my workbench was a speaking tube, a common feature in ol
2 CONC d London town houses from the days before the telephone. Its whistle-plug would usually be bl
2 CONC asted from its socket when my father was at the other end upstairs. This could mean I was nee
2 CONC ded in the surgery for "a gas case". Father administered the anaesthetic himself as well as o
2 CONC perating, which was permitted in those days. Between the face mask and the gasbag was a meta
2 CONC l device containing ether, which he regulated to prolong the anaesthesia. I was required to h
2 CONC old the whole apparatus in position on the face while father manipulated the valves to his sa
2 CONC tisfaction and the patient's stupefaction. Then, poised with forceps at the ready, the signa
2 CONC l would be given; I would drop the contraption, grab the patient's head and watch an unfailin
2 CONC g and fascinating exhibition of high-speed extraction of teeth. Lower forceps, just used, wit
2 CONC h tooth attached, would literally be dropped to the floor en route to grabbing upper forcep
2 CONC s from the bracket table. Father was a most dextrous operator. I rather took his bold and ski
2 CONC lful use of the dental elevator for granted then, but later my own experience and practise br
2 CONC ought me to appreciate it to the full.
2 CONT Concurrently, I attended lectures in chemistry and physics at the Royal Dental Hospital. Soo
2 CONC n I was involved in a motor accident with injury to my right leg which laid me up for six mon
2 CONC ths. With the money I received in compensation, I decided to take medicine as well. This mean
2 CONC t going to the Middlesex Hospital to study biology. Having passed the first Conjoint Examinat
2 CONC ion and my mechanical apprenticeship completed, I entered Guy's Hospital.
2 CONT Guy's Hospital Dental School and Hospital was founded by Newland Pedley in 1902 after he ha
2 CONC d returned from South Africa. The British Government had commissioned him to investigate cond
2 CONC itions of troops in the field. He brought equipment with him and rendered a dental service
2 CONC . I have failed to discover any record of this episode.
2 CONT By today's standards things were primitive. Although the electric dental drill, driven by cab
2 CONC le in casing, was around, the chair-side pedestal unit had not yet arrived on the scene. Eac
2 CONC h student provided his own foot drill and portable cabinet containing essential instruments a
2 CONC nd certain materials (e.g. GP points) for conservative dentistry. We operated mostly by dayli
2 CONC ght. The conservation room had a glass roof that was cooled by water on hot summer days. Th
2 CONC e rear wall was lined with lockers. Each student kept his equipment, white coat, books, rainc
2 CONC oat, sports gear and other paraphernalia in his own locker. A spittoon and wooden table wer
2 CONC e alongside each dental chair. We grabbed the best-lit chair available, taking our patient t
2 CONC o it and setting out our equipment. This was the order of the day, for in no circumstances we
2 CONC re we allowed to reserve a chair or leave our equipment about; everything had to be put bac
2 CONC k in our lockers when not in use.
2 CONT Local anaesthetics were administered by infiltration: 2% Novocain tablets and adrenaline wer
2 CONC e issued together with Ringers isotonic solution. These were mixed and boiled in a small cruc
2 CONC ible over a spirit lamp and then drawn up into an injection syringe with a plunger that rarel
2 CONC y worked smoothly, with consequent discomfort to the patient. Needles were two or three time
2 CONC s as thick as the yet-to-come stainless steel ones and were liable to break. The theory of ne
2 CONC rve block anaesthesia was taught but avoided in practice because of these risks and drawbacks
2 CONC . Although nasal administration of nitrous oxide was being introduced, regular sessions in th
2 CONC e "gas room" were usually exciting experiences involving "straight" administration and the ex
2 CONC traction of as many teeth as possible before the patient came round.
2 CONT This brings to mind my memories, as a very small boy, of the "gasometer" for making nitrous o
2 CONC xide gas, which stood in the corner of my grandfather's surgery. Painted white and less tha
2 CONC n a cubic metre in size, it went up and down in vertical guides and appeared, to my infant ey
2 CONC es, to be a miniature of the enormous gasometers to be seen near towns all over England in th
2 CONC ose days. 
2 CONT By (I think) 1907, it was giving way to the pure bottled N20 in use today. In 1846 -the yea
2 CONC r my grandfather George Pedley started dental practice in London -the recent American discove
2 CONC ry, nitrous oxide, crossed the Atlantic to England. Only when it could be made absolutely pur
2 CONC e did its description, "laughing gas", disappear.
2 CONT To return to Guy's, where there were many South Africans, for Wits Dental School had not ye
2 CONC t come into being, the filling materials we used were limited. I cannot remember the consider
2 CONC able number of cohesive gold fillings we had to literally hammer into place; there was als
2 CONC o a limited number of gold inlays which we had to place and cast ourselves. Tremendous emphas
2 CONC is was placed on the relatively new concept of extension for prevention in cavity preparation
2 CONC . The value of amalgam as a filling when properly prepared and inserted was gaining ground. W
2 CONC e did the occasional porcelain inlay, but the new silicate porcelain from De Trey of Switzerl
2 CONC and boded well for the future, although only later did I learn how to handle it correctly. 
2 CONT Sound principles in crown and bridge work were taught, though few opportunities came the wa
2 CONC y of the student to practise them. Suaged gold (not cast) was used in partial denture work. G
2 CONC erman silver alloy (nickel silver) was used entirely as a "practice material" and one becam
2 CONC e expert in the technique of suaging metal plate and soldering it to the required wires or ba
2 CONC nds (also of NSA) with silver solder. Vulcanite came in red, pink and black. All porcelain "g
2 CONC um sections", which came in blocks of three for the front teeth and two for the premolars, ha
2 CONC d the merit of being less artificial in appearance, but had many limitations.
2 CONT The worst deficiency in the training and teaching of those days, and for years to come, was d
2 CONC isregard for the preservation of the facial contour in edentulous or near edentulous cases o
2 CONC r restoration of the facial contour in longstanding full denture wearers. We were taught to b
2 CONC e good manipulators and technicians. Any artistic sense that any of the teaching staff posses
2 CONC sed was not apparent.
2 CONT However, just before I sat for my finals, I saw full dentures in the mouth of a Salvation Arm
2 CONC y officer in a material similar in appearance to today's acrylic. Named "Walkerite" after th
2 CONC e scientist who invented it, it was to be the forerunner of similar initially good looking bu
2 CONC t short-lived denture materials until the arrival of acrylic plastic in 1938. "Vidon", "Resav
2 CONC in", "Palladon", the celluloids "Heckolite" (German) and "Oralite", were all to become the su
2 CONC bject of investigation and practical application with initial pleasure and ultimate grief.
2 CONT I knew "Oralite" best and used it most. Arriving in Johannesburg in 1936, with the special eq
2 CONC uipment needed, I processed my own Oralite dentures for two years. One day Mr Home of Taylo
2 CONC r and Home Dental Suppliers, brought me a sample of material which had been sent to him fro
2 CONC m Belgium. I tried this out and knew with little doubt that in my hands lay, at last, the en
2 CONC d of the long search for a suitable denture material. It was acrylic resin.
2 CONT When I qualified LDS in February 1926, I received a telegram which read: "Join me immediately
2 CONC , passage paid for". Not unexpected, the message was from Rowland Campion, who had the only B
2 CONC ritish dental practice in Egypt, whom I had met at the end of the 1914-18 War eight years bef
2 CONC ore when he was Captain Campion, RAMC Dental Corps, then in uniform, on leave. 
2 CONT He had been posted to the maxillo-facial unit at Alexandria's Mustafa Hospital for the War an
2 CONC d had decided to set up private practice in Alexandria at the end of hostilities. He had kep
2 CONC t in close touch with me ever since. An added excitement for me was the fact that while I wa
2 CONC s at Guy's (in 1922), Tutankhamen's tomb had been discovered. I had avidly followed every rep
2 CONC ort on the excavations and was "hooked" on the study of Egyptology.
2 CONT From London, crossing the English Channel, Europe and the Mediterranean, it took me four an
2 CONC d a half days to reach Alexandria. Next day I treated 10 patients, communicating with two o
2 CONC f them in bad schoolboy French.
2 CONT As subsequent events were to prove my experience unique, I may perhaps be forgiven for includ
2 CONC ing those aspects of my personal experience in Egypt over nearly two years, which may be of i
2 CONC nterest in tracing the history and development of dentistry to its advanced state in this yea
2 CONC r of 1983. I was to receive a quick succession of shocks and disillusionments that I soon det
2 CONC ermined to regard as lessons learnt and experience gained. It was to prove a classic exampl
2 CONC e of lasting benefit gained from the mismanagement and even stupidity and malpractice of othe
2 CONC rs. What not to do can sometimes be the guide to what best to do.
2 CONT The consulting-rooms were a second floor suite in the American Mission Building in the hear
2 CONC t of the city. There were three surgeries, an X-ray room, a waiting room, a spare room an
2 CONC d a passage where there was a single gas ring on which instruments were sterilised in a sauce
2 CONC pan and upon which Thompson, ex-army Sergeant, medical corps nurse and our general factotum
2 CONC , cooked our midday meal ("I'm afraid we'll have to fall back on an omelette again today!")
2 CONC . The passage led through to the roomy and well-lit laboratory.
2 CONT My bare-floored, uncurtained, unadorned surgery had a washbasin fitted by an incompetent Ara
2 CONC b workman the day before I started. There was an ancient, plush upholstered dental chair wit
2 CONC h bracket table, a spittoon and (oh dear!) a foot engine. A multi-drawered, shabby dental cab
2 CONC inet stood in the corner against the wall. Next to it, on the floor, lay a one metre long nit
2 CONC rous oxide gas bottle with gas mask bag and tube attached. A desk table and chair completed t
2 CONC he depressing scene. The other assistant's surgery was better equipped for a rather ordinar
2 CONC y but likeable little man. He had been a war-time dental mechanic at Mustafa Hospital, who ha
2 CONC d qualified LDS Liverpool with the help of a post-war army grant.
2 CONT The main surgery had the latest invention, a Ritter pedestal unit. The rest was a shambles, b
2 CONC etraying a reluctance to spend money in the interest of efficiency and appearance. The X-ra
2 CONC y room, leading directly by partition doors off the main surgery, housed, in magnificent isol
2 CONC ation, a recently installed Ritter X-ray machine. There was a wash-basin and a contraption o
2 CONC f black curtains in one corner which served as a "dark room".
2 CONT We opened at 8 a.m. and never left before Campion had finished, which could be any time up t
2 CONC o 6 p.m. Campion's clientele was almost exclusively among the well-to-do cosmopolitan communi
2 CONC ty of Alexandria. Their oral cavities became loaded with "gold work". For those with "amalga
2 CONC m incomes" and/or resistance to his sales talk, his assistants were available. However, he wa
2 CONC s always overbooked and behind schedule. My reputation for strict punctuality overcame my you
2 CONC thful appearance and soon gained for me a valued cosmopolitan and Egyptian clientele.
2 CONT We all took Saturday and Thursday afternoons off. I forgot to mention the shower room that of
2 CONC ten provided welcome relief in a climate more hot and humid than Durban!
2 CONT My varied duties kept me constantly busy. The mechanic was soon dismissed for another hardl
2 CONC y more competent. I spent hours in the laboratory daily processing and casting gold inlays an
2 CONC d designing and processing and casting skeletal gold dentures. Taking, developing and reporti
2 CONC ng on X-rays was my responsibility. When the temperature of my solutions and wash exceeded 8
2 CONC 5 Fahrenheit which it did for a few months of the year -the surface of the film would lift, d
2 CONC istort and even float off. I soon worked out that by adding alum to developer, fixer and wash
2 CONC ing water, I was safe for another five degrees or more.
2 CONT While working in the X-ray room I could hear Campion's conversations next door. I soon picke
2 CONC d up a working French dental vocabulary. I took lessons in Arabic because Campion had ideas o
2 CONC f my opening a practice in the native town of Tanta -a pipe dream. The language was only usef
2 CONC ul to me outside the practice. 
2 CONT English, in those days of British prestige and the British mandate, was widely spoken -certai
2 CONC nly by all educated people. The children of the cosmopolitan families who were patients of th
2 CONC e practice all seemed to have (often attractive) English governesses and spoke English as wel
2 CONC l as their parents.
2 CONT My most adventurous role was in the field of general anaesthetics. I was expected to administ
2 CONC er nitrous oxide or ethyl chloride when needed. That long and heavy gas cylinder in my surger
2 CONC y was the only one we had. I did not know when it would empty; there was no spare. 
2 CONT Pulling it across the floor to within reach of the patient, down on one knee with gas mask ov
2 CONC er my own face, I would turn on the supply with a spanner, regulating it to what I hoped wa
2 CONC s a satisfactory flow. Rising to my feet, I would apply the mask to the patient and while reg
2 CONC ulating the valves, I would hope, even pray, for the best.
2 CONT A month after my arrival I had to go before an examining board in Cairo. I was treated with c
2 CONC ourtesy and cordiality mixed with curiosity about nerve-block anaesthesia and 'the latest tea
2 CONC chings and techniques. 
2 CONT In due course my diploma was returned to me duly endorsed in Arabic. Also from the Administra
2 CONC tion of Public Hygiene, a beautifully inscribed "AUTHORISATION D'Excerser la Profession de De
2 CONC ntiste". 
2 CONT This was written, stamped and signed, with sundry endorsements, in both Arabic and French
2 CONC . I prize it among my possessions, a document which could be of interest to future generation
2 CONC s of dentists. A decade later foreign dentists were forbidden and/or expelled from Egypt, th
2 CONC e Cairo Dental School having been founded in 1929.
2 CONT Our local anaesthetic was available in 4 oz bottles with a thick rubber cover stretched tight
2 CONC ly over the bottle mouth. One punctured it with the syringe needle and withdrew the require
2 CONC d amount. It was potent stuff. Campion would draw a certain amount up into his syringe and th
2 CONC en a similar amount from the hot water in the electric saucepan in his surgery, which serve
2 CONC d for sterilising the business end of his hand instruments (i.e. scalers, probes, etc). I cou
2 CONC ld never summon the courage to tell him that the swelling and pain he warned his patients t
2 CONC o expect after an extraction was due to his cheerful disregard for (and probable ignorance of
2 CONC ) the principles of osmosis.
2 CONT Campion knew that I saved the teeth I extracted for the purpose of histological research in t
2 CONC he future. One day he entered my surgery, found an upper first premolar, broke off one of th
2 CONC e roots and hastily departed without comment, for I was attending a patient. Later I was info
2 CONC rmed he had to do this because he had left a root behind in the jaw when extracting. The pati
2 CONC ent had then asked to see the tooth, and he wished to satisfy her that the tooth had been com
2 CONC pletely removed. My scandalised objection was met with contempt and finally an expression o
2 CONC f hope and a prayer (he was a "holy man") that God would guide me to understand.
2 CONT On another occasion I had been requested by an Italian woman (was she one of the many "ladie
2 CONC s of the town"?) to make and fit an almost full upper denture over the many root stumps she f
2 CONC latly refused to have extracted. She had no English and her French was little better than min
2 CONC e. I called Campion to persuade her and he sent me to the laboratory. Soon he came to tell m
2 CONC e that it was pointless talking to her and that I must accede to her request. His reaction t
2 CONC o my shocked refusal, as a matter of principle, was "Very well, then I had better get on wit
2 CONC h it myself", and he returned to the woman in my surgery. I neither heard more of the matte
2 CONC r nor saw the patient again.
2 CONT Thompson was our sole staff except for the erratic services of a 16-year-old Arab boy who per
2 CONC formed the odd small chore, including the transport to the sterilisation point (the gas rin
2 CONC g and saucepan in the passage), and later return, of the instruments we had used. Campion wen
2 CONC t to England on leave and my co-assistant was taking a short holiday. I had become increasing
2 CONC ly conscious of the listlessness and pallor of the Arab boy and one day caught him with his t
2 CONC rousers down and handling a mysterious bottle of fluid; he had gonorrhoea. I learnt later tha
2 CONC t this was his second attack of the disease.
2 CONT Which reminds me that when Campion was again on leave in 1927 I experienced an earthquake. I
2 CONC t was Saturday midday lunch hour. Thompson and I were eating our meal in the spare room (in w
2 CONC hich I was actually living at the time), when the whole place began to shake, the floor heavi
2 CONC ng up and down and my long white coat swinging like a pendulum on its peg on the door. We rus
2 CONC hed onto the small railed balcony, keeping close to the wall. The tram cables in the street b
2 CONC elow were whipping against the poles. A strange sultry quiet prevailed, broken at last by Tho
2 CONC mpson's voice with its broad Scottish accent: "It's aboot time the Lord visited this wicked c
2 CONC ity". The longest two minutes of my life had passed and we went off to inspect the building f
2 CONC or (thankfully not too serious) cracks.
2 CONT When I had three weeks leave I stayed with friends in Palestine, journeying through the nigh
2 CONC t to Jerusalem on the war-time-built railway across the Sinai Desert; roads were primitive. W
2 CONC ith Bible in pocket, I did a great deal of walking around. Jerusalem and Bethlehem were mostl
2 CONC y under snow. In Jericho, some 1,200 feet below sea level, I was in my shirtsleeves.
2 CONT An old school and medical friend in Haifa did his rounds on horseback. In token of a long fri
2 CONC endship and appreciation for some dental service I rendered in his clinic in the then harbour
2 CONC less town, he gave me a violin (much better than my own) which a patient had willed to him.
2 CONT Only recently freed from centuries of Turkish domination, Palestine in 1927 seemed to me to b
2 CONC reathe relief under the British Mandate. How different things would be on my next visit 34 ye
2 CONC ars later.
2 CONT Near the end of my stay in Egypt, I teamed up with a fluent-in-Arabic friend and motored in m
2 CONC y little Citroen along the canal-side dirt roads to Cairo for a last fling. On returning to A
2 CONC lexandria I left wonderful, mysterious, sunny Egypt with mixed feelings of regret and relief.
2 CONT However, one more aspect of my Egyptian experience had to be faced when I had arrived back i
2 CONC n London. I received flattering requests and offers of influential backing to persuade me t
2 CONC o return and open a practice in Cairo. Any plans I may have had to take advantage of these of
2 CONC fers were thwarted by the inadvisability of contesting the fact that my contract of assistant
2 CONC ship with Campion had bound me out of all Egypt for ten years.
2 CONT There followed a search from London to Bristol for a suitable and permanent place in which t
2 CONC o settle. It was to be in a home-based practice in Streatham, London, SW, with a branch pract
2 CONC ice at 51 Welbeck Street Wl. It was owned by Harold Harrison, whose ill-health was apparent w
2 CONC hen he engaged me as his sole assistant. Two weeks later he collapsed in his surgery at Welbe
2 CONC ck Street and it was to be six months before he could return to work, when he took me into pa
2 CONC rtnership. This was to be my life and work for the next eight years until, married to a Sout
2 CONC h African girl, I would emigrate to her country.
2 CONT The West End practice was run in association with that of Mr Nixon, a leading dentist of Edin
2 CONC burgh. His elite clients had London bases and regularly "came down for the London Season" I f
2 CONC ound myself treating the well known, the aristocratic and titled society. One of my favourite
2 CONC s was lady-in-waiting to Queen Mary. I learnt a great deal from her great charm of manner an
2 CONC d speech. Her eloquence was so erudite and delightful that I used to jot down unaccustomed wo
2 CONC rds she might use for later study at home.
2 CONT Another I have cause to remember, although for different reasons, was an imposing, florid Maj
2 CONC or General- ex Indian Army -who I was reluctantly obliged to render edentulous in the cours
2 CONC e of four administrations of gas. I used on him a valuable trick I had learnt in Egypt and em
2 CONC ployed regularly. Often heavy drinkers go rigid and arch their backs as anaesthesia becomes e
2 CONC ffective. For suspected drinkers, I kept a harness strap handy and at the right moment of ind
2 CONC uction would pass it round the patient's middle and buckle it firmly underneath the chair. Ha
2 CONC ving operated, I would release the strap and hide it away. Some time later, when the Genera
2 CONC l had become an accustomed denture-wearer, said he: "Each time you took out teeth for me, I t
2 CONC hink, young man, you slipped something round my middle and pinned me down?" "Yes Sir," I repl
2 CONC ied, "I did." "Could it have been a harness strap?" he asked. "Yes Sir, it was." "Ha! I thoug
2 CONC ht so. I wasn't in the cavalry all those years for nothing!"
2 CONT Harrison's recovery did not last long. The West End connection was disposed of and in due cou
2 CONC rse, in 1931, I bought Harrison out and moved the busy Streatham practice to my own house a
2 CONC t 14 Becmead Avenue.
2 CONT Meanwhile I had obtained part-time appointments to three London Hospitals. One was the Magdal
2 CONC en Hospital for Destitute Women. This was an emergency service in that it entailed eliminatin
2 CONC g obvious sepsis and sending the patients for employment in Australia or far from their origi
2 CONC ns. Most of them were under 17 and had been born to prostitutes operating in mid and norther
2 CONC n cities of Britain.
2 CONT Another was the British Home and Hospital for Incurables, mostly advanced rheumatoid arthriti
2 CONC s cases. I found the mouths in a sorely neglected state and worked to effect a clean-up and t
2 CONC hereby general improvement and arrest of the disease. I was disappointed. One very old edentu
2 CONC lous lady there was put out by the late appearance of an upper right wisdom tooth. After I ha
2 CONC d removed it under a slight whiff of gas, she examined the tooth closely, remarking that my n
2 CONC ame was an unusual one and asked could I be connected with a dentist she knew long, long ag
2 CONC o -a certain George Pedley? When I replied in the affirmative, she embraced me saying "Your g
2 CONC randfather was a dear, dear man; under gas which he administered, he took out my first bad ba
2 CONC by teeth. I wanted to be sure you had really managed to get that wretched buried tooth (I hop
2 CONC e my last one) out before I told you."
2 CONT The third hospital appointment that I instigated was one morning a week at the London Countr
2 CONC y Councils' Hospital at Dulwich. There were fourteen hundred beds. Also attached was an anten
2 CONC atal clinic as well as a home for epileptics. I was given a room to equip and was welcomed b
2 CONC y the medical staff with relief.
2 CONT In, I think 1934, I was invited by the doctor on duty to try the "latest discovery" on my hos
2 CONC pital patient who was due for a full mouth clearance. It was the first intravenous anaestheti
2 CONC c "EVIPIAN". This was spectacular and alarming. After two or more cases I decided that it wa
2 CONC s not to be risked on my private patients. I was first asked how long I expected to be operat
2 CONC ing. The syringe would then be filled with the specific amount for the period required. The w
2 CONC hole of the contents would be injected in the vein AND THE SYRINGE WITHDRAWN. The patient wen
2 CONC t out in a few seconds, as happens today, but tended to rigidity and violence. Trismus wa
2 CONC s a problem and usually created real difficulties. On recovery there could be alarming violen
2 CONC ce. 
2 CONT A decade and the War was to pass before I encountered the intravenous method again. Johannesb
2 CONC urg had to wait a few more years before PENTATHOL and "drip" became routine with our anaesthe
2 CONC tists.
2 CONT After five years at Dulwich Hospital treating everything that came my way within or beyond m
2 CONC y capacity, including fractures, I was involved in a case which led to Parliamentary Question
2 CONC s and debate and the final re-organisation of the dental services in all the hospitals of th
2 CONC e London County Council. I had cleaned up a unilateral mandibular osteomyelitis with the usua
2 CONC l collapse of the affected side, persuaded the patient to discharge himself and had him admit
2 CONC ted to Guy's Hospital for the restorative operation by Sir William Kelsey-Fry. This was deeme
2 CONC d irregular, but the rectitude of my behaviour was obvious. I was asked to report fully on ot
2 CONC her cases I had encountered in the course of my duties at Dulwich. I told of how I had ofte
2 CONC n used my private dental laboratory, for
2 CONT instance for constructing splints in fracture cases. The result was that a dental laborator
2 CONC y was created near London's centre, fully equipped and with adequate, well trained staff. I t
2 CONC hen retired from the scene with a by no means unappreciative testimonial.
2 CONT Having a dental practice with dental laboratory in one's home is not conducive to domestic tr
2 CONC anquillity. Friction between family, domestic and professional staff is usually not far fro
2 CONC m the surface. Then there is the weather, which the English endure because they are born to i
2 CONC t, and don't know any better. Those long, cold, grey, wet months with so relatively short a r
2 CONC espite. Little wonder that with Egypt and South Africa nostalgically in mind, we decided to "
2 CONC pull up our roots" and exchange security in dreary London for uncertainty in a sunny land ful
2 CONC l of promise for the future.
2 CONT Our intention had to be kept a close-guarded secret. Fifteen months and 44 interviews later (
2 CONC all conducted with time-consuming patience on Sundays only), the practice was sold. By July 1
2 CONC 936 my car, furniture, family, white nanny and I were on board the Windsor Castle along wit
2 CONC h the many who were fleeing Hitler's impending wrath. I had my 33rd birthday on board. Cape T
2 CONC own was bathed in glorious sunshine as I put my family on the train for Krugersdorp. I joine
2 CONC d them there four days later, having negotiated 900 miles of dirt roads and opened and close
2 CONC d (it seemed) a 100 farm gates.
2 CONT While waiting for my new Emda Equipment to arrive from Germany, and in order to gain essentia
2 CONC l local experience, for a few weeks I worked for Drs Bengis and Lewis in Brakpan. This wa
2 CONC s a most valuable exercise. They were advanced in ideas and techniques, using nerve block ana
2 CONC esthesia in conservation and employing the new fine stainless steel needles and carpule syrin
2 CONC ges. This experience firmly entrenched my determination to promote this trend. I discovered t
2 CONC hat Johannesburg dentists were being seduced by the special gas and oxygen anaelgesia apparat
2 CONC us on the market. 
2 CONT At Guy's, five years before, I had attended a demonstration of the method being used in cavit
2 CONC y preparation. It was being given, experimentally and tentatively in the dental field, by D
2 CONC r Minute, who had pioneered and used it extensively and successfully to relieve the pangs o
2 CONC f childbirth. It was obvious to me that in the dental field it would have a limited applicati
2 CONC on and that the ideal of completely painless dentistry could not lie in that direction.
2 CONT Establishing a new dental practice from scratch in Johannesburg was a slow business. I did al
2 CONC l my own dental mechanics for five years. My perseverance in rejecting and diverting casual t
2 CONC reatment and insisting on a properly structured treatment plan in all cases brought its ultim
2 CONC ate reward. In 1944 and 1945 I paid war-time excess profit duty of fifteen shillings in the p
2 CONC ound.
2 CONT In 1940, Dicky Bird, then Colonel Bird, Director of Army Dental Services, asked me to come t
2 CONC o Pretoria for an interview. He made me a tempting offer but as matrimonial problems are no
2 CONC t resolved by running away, I refused and saw the matter through to ultimate divorce.
2 CONT From 1952 to my retirement in 1969 I employed assistants and freed myself from general denta
2 CONC l practice in order to pursue exclusively my own unique speciality of facial restorations. Th
2 CONC is involved restructuring the original contours of the face and profile of patients sufferin
2 CONC g the ravages of multiple or total loss of the natural dentition. It also involved a sensitiv
2 CONC e awareness of the need to cater for those changes which Nature's hand places on all in cours
2 CONC e of time. I have restored full denture wearers of 40 years and more. I did my own set-ups an
2 CONC d alterations to set-ups in my own small, private laboratory. The patient took home the nea
2 CONC r final try-in for personal and family appraisal. The clay bust created by the sculptor mus
2 CONC t never be altered in the slightest by the bronze founder. In the same way my technician proc
2 CONC essed my work exactly in the form in which I had given it to him.
2 CONT On arrival in Johannesburg, I joined the Dental Association of South Africa (then the SADA)
2 CONC , as well as the recently founded Odontological Society of South Africa. I came to hold hig
2 CONC h office in both, the Odontological Society awarding me their Fellowship in 1951 and their fi
2 CONC rst Honorary Life Membership in 1967.
2 CONT I represented the Dental Association of South Africa on the Governing Body of the Oral and De
2 CONC ntal Hospital for twelve successive years from 1940, witnessing and influencing the hospital'
2 CONC s removal from its site now occupied by South African Airways Rotunda Terminal building to it
2 CONC s present location which necessitated blasting away a rock koppie on the corner of the Witwat
2 CONC ersrand University Campus. My part in the founding of the Professional Provident Society ha
2 CONC s been recorded elsewhere. I was a member of the original Committee of Management in 1940.
2 CONT To put my personal and specialised practice on the market would have proved a futile exercise
2 CONC . The equipment, however, was sold and in April 1969 I closed the door and walked away to a c
2 CONC ontented retirement, lasting to date almost 15 years, in my mountain home "MOUNTHAVEN" at Kos
2 CONC mos, the village I helped develop on the Hartebeespoort Dam.
2 CONT This is the end of a dental saga which I hope will be of interest to those who follow me in t
2 CONC he profession. The Pedley name continues into the fourth generation; my nephew, Eric's son Ti
2 CONC mothy, is in settled dental practice in England.
2 CONT EPILOGUE
2 CONT At Xmas time in 1947 I married Peggy, for four years a teacher of physical education at the T
2 CONC eachers Training College at Graaf Reinet. I had known Peggy, fifteen years younger than I, fo
2 CONC r years as a person of sterling character and worth, always dependable and reliable. Her attr
2 CONC active appearance was an added, and to me important, bonus.
2 CONT After five years Peggy presented me with a daughter, Diana, a welcome addition, in my fiftiet
2 CONC h year, to my earlier brood of two sons and a daughter, then in their 'teens and twenties.
2 CONT After 35 years of shared interests, endeavour and understanding, with our quota of pain and p
2 CONC leasure, we enjoy the good life to the full in our "Mounthaven".
2 CONT With study and constant application we have developed our love of scenic painting and Peggy h
2 CONC er (by now well known) gift for flower painting. From my collection of gemstones I also creat
2 CONC e jewellery, which I make at my old dental workbench, set up, together with polishing lathe a
2 CONC nd tools, in my workshop at home. We display and sell our work in our Art Gallery which is th
2 CONC e focus of frequent visitors from near and far.
2 CONT Mounthaven is full of books, treasured possessions and some fifty pieces of furniture I hav
2 CONC e made over the years. Good music, mostly piano, from our record collection lends joyful soun
2 CONC d to the atmosphere of contentment and peace of mind. The stimulation of good conversation wi
2 CONC th friends, old and new, adds much to the quality of our life.
2 CONT Soon will come the end of the road and an agnostic's calm acceptance of what may or may not l
2 CONC ie beyond. After all, BELIEF IS A MATTER OF CONVICTION AND NOT NECESSARILY THE TRUTH.

2 CONT Partly reprosuced here:
2 CONT 
2 CONT History
2 CONT In the beginning...
2 CONT The earliest beginnings of golf in the Crewe area are shrouded in the mists of time. There is
2 CONC , for instance, some tantalising evidence of Golf being played at various sites in Crewe befo
2 CONC re 1893. Also, in the day books for 1911 - 1914, which survived the Club House fire of 1969
2 CONC , visitors were naming home clubs at Nantwich, Alvaston, Alsager, and Barthomley as well as s
2 CONC uch still-thriving clubs as Sandbach, Mossley and Wolstanton.
2 CONT Of one thing, however, we can be certain, our present Club's origins can be traced back to No
2 CONC vember 1910 when a group of people, of whom Dr. E. C. Bailey was elected chairman, met at th
2 CONC e Euston Coffee Tavern in Earle Street to discuss a proposition that a golf club should be fo
2 CONC rmed. A Provisional Committee was set up to hunt around the vicinity for a suitable site.
2 CONT By December 1910, Bailey and his committee had examined a number of possibilities, the most s
2 CONC uitable being at Mr. Booth's Fields Farm, Haslington. The proposition was: 
2 CONT Rent - £4perannum 
2 CONT Fairways to be mown 60 yards wide beginning 100 yards from the tees 
2 CONT Greens to be made and fenced - not more than 25 sq. yards in area 
2 CONT Bunkers to be allowed provided they did not interfere with cattle grazing 
2 CONT A Club House and tool sheds to be allowed 
2 CONT Also grazing rights for one horse, but 
2 CONT No dogs and no play on Sundays. 
2 CONT In January1911, a General Meeting was called and the proposal was accepted on the basis o
2 CONC f a 14 years lease. A Founder Committee with Mr. R. Baxter Booth as its Chairman was elected
2 CONC . This committee set to work to turn the outline proposition into a real golf course.
2 CONT After a great deal of work and preparation, the formation of the new club was agreed and th
2 CONC e first groundsman, Samuel Burgess, was appointed at a wage of £1 a week. Later, his son wa
2 CONC s employed at 5 shillings a week. By the 9th of May the Founder Committee had completed its w
2 CONC ork and once more a General Meeting was called at the Euston Coffee House at which the firs
2 CONC t officers of Crewe Golf Club were elected. They were:
2 CONT President:	W. W. Warneford	
2 CONT Captain:	R. Baxter Booth	
2 CONT Treasurer:	W. H. Hughes	
2 CONT Secretary:	W. Boyle

1 NOTE BIOGRAPHY: Written by Clifford Pedley:
2 CONT Tom Pedley, the eldest son of George, obtained his MD at Charing Cross and was among the earl
2 CONC iest to obtain the RCS diploma in dentistry. Tom started his career as a ship's doctor on th
2 CONC e popular and busy P & 0 LINE of steamships plying to India. One day, when approaching the Po
2 CONC rt of Burma, Uncle Tom was stabbed in the neck by one of the passengers with delirium tremens
2 CONC . He recovered in hospital in Rangoon and stayed there to practise medicine for 44 years. H
2 CONC e became Colonel-in-Chief of the Indian Medical Corps and was awarded the Kaiser-I-Hind medal
2 CONC . In 1925, at age 73, he died while having an after-lunch nap on his surgery couch. When I ca
2 CONC me to Johannesburg in 1936, I was invited to call on a local medical practitioner, Dr Peacock
2 CONC . When he had satisfied himself that I was indeed a nephew of the late Colonel Tom Pedley, h
2 CONC e showed me a set of dental forceps Tom had given him when Dr Peacock served under him in th
2 CONC e I.M. Corps. 1 happened to know that this was a gesture my uncle liked to make to young MO'
2 CONC s who had pleased him. There were six or more forceps housed in a black leather folder.

2 CONT DEATH: From R. J. Wilkinson, Rangoon. 
2 CONT The following are the facts, as far as I can relate them, regarding Tom's death: -
2 CONT On Friday evening last the 13th January, shortly after I had go home from office, I was calle
2 CONC d on the 'phone by Mr. Hood (I should say here that Tom had let his house when he went to Eng
2 CONC land last year to Mr and Mrs Hood, and when he returned he asked them to stay on and live i
2 CONC n the house with him.) Mr Hood said Dr Pedley was in a state of collapse, and I am afraid i
2 CONC s dying. I immediately went down to Bridge House which is only 5 minutes away from Belmont. M
2 CONC rs Hood met me in the portico and said that Dr Douglas had just arrived and was upstairs wit
2 CONC h Dr. Pedley. It would then be about 5:40 p.m., I think. Tom was lying on his bed on his bac
2 CONC k minus his coat and waistcoat, and with his shoes off. To me he seemed asleep but with his m
2 CONC outh wide open. I asked Dr Douglas what he though of him and he said "I am afraid he is alrea
2 CONC dy gone, but if so can only be just have gone within the last minute or two". I waited whil
2 CONC e Dr Douglas felt him in various ways but he soon turned to me and said that he was undoubted
2 CONC ly dead but the end must have come in sleep and absolutely painless. 
2 CONT The Revd. Drysdale come over from his house and I invited him to come up to the bedroom and w
2 CONC e neither of us seemed to realize that he was actually and so very suddenly gone. Mrs Hood to
2 CONC ld me that Dr Pedley had had a very bad night on Thursday, telling her in the morning that h
2 CONC e had had some heart seizure and scarcely slept all night so he did not go out before breakfa
2 CONC st as usual, but lay in bed until 10:00 a.m. or so, sleeping. After that he felt better and g
2 CONC ot up and went to his consulting rooms in town seeing his patients there and then went his ro
2 CONC und visiting his patients. Mrs Hood said he came home about 3 p.m. which was earlier than cus
2 CONC tomary, and told her he felt very tired and would go up to his room and get a little sleep. A
2 CONC bout 5 p.m.  she went up to see him and asked if she could get him some tea, or did he fanc
2 CONC y anything else. He asked for a cup of cocoa and this she brought him and left him. Some Burm
2 CONC ese patient came to see him and he sent word down for him to come up to his bedroom as he wa
2 CONC s too tired to go down to his consulting room. The patient did so and left in a few minutes
2 CONC . At 5.20 p. m. Mrs Hood heard Dr. Pedley go along the corridor upstairs (probably to the bat
2 CONC hroom) and return again to his room. She had when taking him the cocoa asked if she should ca
2 CONC ll a Doctor and he said she might ring up for Dr Whitmore if she likes. She did this bet he w
2 CONC as out and Mr Hood who had come then rang up in succession for Dr. Scott, Dr Kelsall, and Dr
2 CONC . Spence, but every one of these Doctors were out. He then rang up for Dr. Douglas and fortun
2 CONC ately he was at home and came at once. . Mrs Hood went upstairs while her husband was telepho
2 CONC ning and she thought Dr Pedley looked as if asleep but when Mr Hood cam e up he feared the wo
2 CONC rst and phoned for me.  So far as the Hoods knew Dr. Pedley had never complained of heart tro
2 CONC uble before the attack of Thursday but he had several times in recent weeks complained of sli
2 CONC ght asthmatic trouble and attributed it to the excessively dust laden atmosphere of the tow
2 CONC n at this time of year. In fact he had only a few days before mentioned it to me and remarke
2 CONC d that a cold that I then had was due to dust more than anything else. Dr Douglas waited on t
2 CONC he bedside for some time and eventually said "there is nothing more can be done but if I ca
2 CONC n be of any assistance to you in any way I shall be only too glad to help you." He remarked t
2 CONC hat to be thus cut off in full harness working up to the very last and dying painlessly afte
2 CONC r all was the best fort of death any man could desire and merely added that poor old Pedley h
2 CONC as been overworking himself of late and certainly should have never attempted to work that da
2 CONC y. I took advice from Douglas about the funeral and he said that in the ordinary course the f
2 CONC uneral should take place next morning and I should phone to the undertakers at once also thei
2 CONC r place would be closed for the night. I asked Dr Douglas if a Post Mortem would be necessar
2 CONC y and he said "Not at all. I can write out the Death Certificate certifying the death as fro
2 CONC m Heart Failure" and this he did. I asked him about the proper laying out of the body and h
2 CONC e said the undertakers would see to that, but I said I new the relatives would like it more r
2 CONC everently done so he kindly promised to do his best and get a Minto nurse to com and went o
2 CONC f at once and returning very soon after, bringing the senior Minto matron and a nurse back i
2 CONC n his car with him, and these two ladies shortly after performed the necessary offices whils
2 CONC t Mrs Hood kindly got them what they wanted. 
2 CONT After this and consulting with the Revd., Drysdale, who was anxious to help in every way, I f
2 CONC ound that there would be little chance of securing burial in the Cantonment Cemetery (now clo
2 CONC sed to all save Military and Government Officials) if the funeral had to be in the morning, s
2 CONC o I appealed to Dr. Douglas again and he said I might safely defer it to the afternoon. Mrs D
2 CONC rysdale then undertook to see the Chaplain of the Cemetery and urge from him permission fo
2 CONC r a grave to be allocated near that of Minnie, and also to say that Dr Pedley had surely som
2 CONC e claim to that Cemetery as he was a Volunteer Officer for 40 years standing. This seen to
2 CONC , I sent of a cablegram to Croydon, and a telegram to Allahabad, and then phoned the local ne
2 CONC wspapers to get the announcement of his death and the time and place of the funeral inserte
2 CONC d in the Saturday morning issues. After this I went upstairs to see Tom, and the face was no
2 CONC w quite set and the features more peaceful looking. I remained on at Bridge House answering t
2 CONC elephone calls and personal callers until 10 p.m. The Revd. Drysdale had come in again at abo
2 CONC ut 9 p.m. saying the Cantonment Chaplain would meet me in the cemetery at 7:30 in the morning
2 CONC . I returned to Bridge House soon after 6 a.m. on Saturday and at 7.15 am Mr Drysdale and I w
2 CONC ent to the cemetery and me Chaplain Thursfield. I took them to Minnies Grave, and although th
2 CONC ere was no vacant space on either side there was room for 3 graves in front, but on consultin
2 CONC g the register it was found two of them were secured by right to relatives of the adjoining g
2 CONC raves. Eventually after scanning plans and sided by the memory of the Native Curator, we foun
2 CONC d we could get the plot almost in front of Minnie's, and without any intervening grave. The C
2 CONC urator then asked who the grave was for, and on being told Dr Pedley, the poor man burst int
2 CONC o tears, and said he had known him for over 20 years. All Saturday morning was spent answerin
2 CONC g verbal and telephone enquiries, etc., I had phoned on Friday night to the officer commandin
2 CONC g the Port Defence Force, and their Adjutant came to see me in the morning and said they hope
2 CONC d to arrange a Military Funeral and he would try to get the Royal Scots to provide a Band an
2 CONC d Firing party. He did his best but at 4 p.m.  had to let me know it could not be managed a
2 CONC s it being Saturday afternoon the Volunteers could not be so hurriedly got together, ad the R
2 CONC oyal Scots unfortunately where booked elsewhere. The St. John Ambulance Brigade asked if the
2 CONC y might attend in uniform and be allowed to carry the coffin from the cemetery gates to the g
2 CONC rave, and this was  readily granted, and I told them I knew their section would be appreciate
2 CONC d by Dr Pedley's relatives. Knowing that Minnie, Ray, Charles and Jack were all Church of Eng
2 CONC land, I asked Chaplain Thursfield to take the Service, but said I would appreciate it, an
2 CONC d I believed you all would too, if the Revd. Drysdale  was allowed to take some part as he wa
2 CONC s such a close personal friend of the Doctor. The Chaplain said he felt sure this could be ar
2 CONC ranged. Later the Bishop 'phoned saying he was most anxious to pay his respect himself, and b
2 CONC e allowed to pronounce the Benediction and he said he fully approved of Mr Drysdale reading t
2 CONC he Lesson. So far as could be done, notice of the funeral was circulate generally throughou
2 CONC t the town, but indeed it scarcely needed this as the news had spread to most quarters on Fri
2 CONC day night. Troops of friends of all races came to Bridge  House all day Saturday and were all
2 CONC owed to see the body, but about 1 p.m. after I had, in company with Mr Drysdale see the corps
2 CONC e, carefully and reverently placed in the coffin, we both thought it wiser to have it closed
2 CONC . Beautiful Wreaths kept coming in all day from all sorts of people and people themselves con
2 CONC tinued coming all afternoon, both European and Eurasian as well as members of Burmese and oth
2 CONC er races.
2 CONT The funeral left the house at 4.30  p. m. the coffin and the hearse being covered with wreath
2 CONC s. It was followed first by the St. Johns Ambulance Squad, then by me in company with the Rev
2 CONC . Drysdale and Mr Hood. After many  motors and carriages and a crowd on foot. It reached th
2 CONC e cemetery at 4.50 where a very large crowd, mostly Eurasians were awaiting it. Immediately t
2 CONC he ambulance men shouldered the coffin the chaplain preceded, reciting the usual verses, an
2 CONC d then Mr Drysdale. Arrived at the graveside Mr Drysdale read the lesson, and then the Bisho
2 CONC p took the whole of the commitment Service and finally pronounced the Benediction.
2 CONT Of the Doctors present I saw Colonel Dee, Colonel Lalor, Colonel Penny, Major Kelsall, Majo
2 CONC r Scott, Major Parakh Whitmore, Dr Parakh, Dr. Murray and Dr Spence. There was a goodly few m
2 CONC ilitary Officers in Uniform, including the Station Staff Officer and some Gunner Officers. Th
2 CONC ere were many government officials, and very many of the Mercantile Community, but the most n
2 CONC otable feature was the variety of different communities represented. I felt that in everythin
2 CONC g had been done as far as it was possible for me, in the way Tom's absent relatives would hav
2 CONC e wished. 
2 CONT At the close of the Rev. J. A. Drysdales sermon at the Scots Kirk, Rangoon on Sunday evenin
2 CONC g 15th Jan, he said as follows:- 
2 CONT “Very suddenly on Friday evening we lost from the Company of the Church Militant a dear frien
2 CONC d, neighbour, and fellow worshipper - Thomas Franklin Pedley - I do not trust myself at thi
2 CONC s time to speak many words of one who honoured me with his friendship, and to whom I owe man
2 CONC y and great kindnesses. But I am only one of many who desire to pay to his memory a tribute o
2 CONC f affection and of esteem. Born sixty seven years ago last Christmas Eve, DR Pedley gave fort
2 CONC y two years of a vigorous, active, many sided Christian life to this city of Rangoon and to t
2 CONC his land of Burma, which he loved. We need not praise him. His own life, his deeds, his memor
2 CONC y are eloquent with high service and generous purpose. 
2 CONT When last evening the great company of all ranks and classes of the community cam to lay to r
2 CONC est in the Cantonment Cemetery what was mortal of him, we all knew we had lost one who's plac
2 CONC e will not be filled  in our life and hearts. 
2 CONT There is given to the great profession of which Dr. Pedley was an honoured member - more perh
2 CONC aps than to any other - a certainly in  a wider and more general way - a key to the hearts o
2 CONC f men. That is the key of close personal interest, and of sympathy, of help, of friendship. T
2 CONC his key to many hearts Dr Pedley had. It is an encouragement to us to remember, at a time whe
2 CONC n so many of our Burmese and Indian fellow subjects disbelieve in our concern for them and th
2 CONC eir welfare, we had one of our number in who all those who met him and knew him could not dis
2 CONC believe. He was a Christian gentleman, who, because of his own Christian faith, was enabled t
2 CONC o maintain these long years - and more especially these later years shadowed by death and th
2 CONC e absence of his loved ones - a deep and patient sympathy with the afflicted of all races an
2 CONC d creeds. 
2 CONT If it is not possible to believe that this full, active, kindly life is at an end, any more t
2 CONC han to believe that the great river ceases to flow when it passes over a fall in its course
2 CONC . WE give thanks to the Awful Disposer of Life and Death for this gift to us of a strong, bra
2 CONC ve, triumphant life, and we surrender back to Him what he lent to us for a season. We mourn o
2 CONC ne who was dear to us. We give our sympathy to his bereaved daughter and sons, to his family
2 CONC , and to the wide circle of his friends. We ask for them the consolations of God. We have n
2 CONC o need to sorrow as those who have no hope. 
2 CONT Come away: for life and thought 
2 CONT Here no longer dwell
2 CONT But in a City glorious 
2 CONT A great and distant city and have bought
2 CONT A mansion incorruptible
2 CONT Would they could have stayed with us! 
2 CONT 
2 CONT DEATH: Amen” 
2 CONT The whole of this was delivered by the Minister with deep emotion which his voice betrayed. 
2 CONT The service closed with the beautiful hymn beginning -
2 CONT "How Bright those glorious spirits shine." 
2 CONT 
2 CONT 
2 CONT 
2 CONT 
2 CONT The following are the facts, as far as I can relate them, regarding Tom's death: -
2 CONT 
2 CONT On Friday evening last the 13th January, shortly after I had go home from office, I was calle
2 CONC d on the 'phone by Mr. Hood (I should say here that Tom had let his house when he went to Eng
2 CONC land last year to Mr and Mrs Hood, and when he returned he asked them to stay on and live i
2 CONC n the house with him.) Mr Hood said Dr Pedley was in a state of collapse, and I am afraid i
2 CONC s dying. I immediately went down to Bridge House which is only 5 minutes away from Belmont. M
2 CONC rs Hood met me in the portico and said that Dr Douglas had just arrived and was upstairs wit
2 CONC h Dr. Pedley. It would then be about 5:40 p.m., I think. Tom was lying on his bed on his bac
2 CONC k minus his coat and waistcoat, and with his shoes off. To me he seemed asleep but with his m
2 CONC outh wide open. I asked Dr Douglas what he though of him and he said "I am afraid he is alrea
2 CONC dy gone, but if so can only be just have gone within the last minute or two". I waited whil
2 CONC e Dr Douglas felt him in various ways but he soon turned to me and said that he was undoubted
2 CONC ly dead but the end must have come in sleep and absolutely painless. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT The Revd. Drysdale come over from his house and I invited him to come up to the bedroom and w
2 CONC e neither of us seemed to realize that he was actually and so very suddenly gone. Mrs Hood to
2 CONC ld me that Dr Pedley had had a very bad night on Thursday, telling her in the morning that h
2 CONC e had had some heart seizure and scarcely slept all night so he did not go out before breakfa
2 CONC st as usual, but lay in bed until 10:00 a.m. or so, sleeping. After that he felt better and g
2 CONC ot up and went to his consulting rooms in town seeing his patients there and then went his ro
2 CONC und visiting his patients. Mrs Hood said he came home about 3 p.m. which was earlier than cus
2 CONC tomary, and told her he felt very tired and would go up to his room and get a little sleep. A
2 CONC bout 5 p.m.  she went up to see him and asked if she could get him some tea, or did he fanc
2 CONC y anything else. He asked for a cup of cocoa and this she brought him and left him. Some Burm
2 CONC ese patient came to see him and he sent word down for him to come up to his bedroom as he wa
2 CONC s too tired to go down to his consulting room. The patient did so and left in a few minutes
2 CONC . At 5.20 p. m. Mrs Hood heard Dr. Pedley go along the corridor upstairs (probably to the bat
2 CONC hroom) and return again to his room. She had when taking him the cocoa asked if she should ca
2 CONC ll a Doctor and he said she might ring up for Dr Whitmore if she likes. She did this bet he w
2 CONC as out and Mr Hood who had come then rang up in succession for Dr. Scott, Dr Kelsall, and Dr
2 CONC . Spence, but every one of these Doctors were out. He then rang up for Dr. Douglas and fortun
2 CONC ately he was at home and came at once. . Mrs Hood went upstairs while her husband was telepho
2 CONC ning and she thought Dr Pedley looked as if asleep but when Mr Hood cam e up he feared the wo
2 CONC rst and phoned for me.  So far as the Hoods knew Dr. Pedley had never complained of heart tro
2 CONC uble before the attack of Thursday but he had several times in recent weeks complained of sli
2 CONC ght asthmatic trouble and attributed it to the excessively dust laden atmosphere of the tow
2 CONC n at this time of year. In fact he had only a few days before mentioned it to me and remarke
2 CONC d that a cold that I then had was due to dust more than anything else. Dr Douglas waited on t
2 CONC he bedside for some time and eventually said "there is nothing more can be done but if I ca
2 CONC n be of any assistance to you in any way I shall be only too glad to help you." He remarked t
2 CONC hat to be thus cut off in full harness working up to the very last and dying painlessly afte
2 CONC r all was the best fort of death any man could desire and merely added that poor old Pedley h
2 CONC as been overworking himself of late and certainly should have never attempted to work that da
2 CONC y. I took advice from Douglas about the funeral and he said that in the ordinary course the f
2 CONC uneral should take place next morning and I should phone to the undertakers at once also thei
2 CONC r place would be closed for the night. I asked Dr Douglas if a Post Mortem would be necessar
2 CONC y and he said "Not at all. I can write out the Death Certificate certifying the death as fro
2 CONC m Heart Failure" and this he did. I asked him about the proper laying out of the body and h
2 CONC e said the undertakers would see to that, but I said I new the relatives would like it more r
2 CONC everently done so he kindly promised to do his best and get a Minto nurse to com and went o
2 CONC f at once and returning very soon after, bringing the senior Minto matron and a nurse back i
2 CONC n his car with him, and these two ladies shortly after performed the necessary offices whils
2 CONC t Mrs Hood kindly got them what they wanted. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT After this and consulting with the Revd., Drysdale, who was anxious to help in every way, I f
2 CONC ound that there would be little chance of securing burial in the Cantonment Cemetery (now clo
2 CONC sed to all save Military and Government Officials) if the funeral had to be in the morning, s
2 CONC o I appealed to Dr. Douglas again and he said I might safely defer it to the afternoon. Mrs D
2 CONC rysdale then undertook to see the Chaplain of the Cemetery and urge from him permission fo
2 CONC r a grave to be allocated near that of Minnie, and also to say that Dr Pedley had surely som
2 CONC e claim to that Cemetery as he was a Volunteer Officer for 40 years standing. This seen to
2 CONC , I sent of a cablegram to Croydon, and a telegram to Allahabad, and then phoned the local ne
2 CONC wspapers to get the announcement of his death and the time and place of the funeral inserte
2 CONC d in the Saturday morning issues. After this I went upstairs to see Tom, and the face was no
2 CONC w quite set and the features more peaceful looking. I remained on at Bridge House answering t
2 CONC elephone calls and personal callers until 10 p.m. The Revd. Drysdale had come in again at abo
2 CONC ut 9 p.m. saying the Cantonment Chaplain would meet me in the cemetery at 7:30 in the morning
2 CONC . I returned to Bridge House soon after 6 a.m. on Saturday and at 7.15 am Mr Drysdale and I w
2 CONC ent to the cemetery and me Chaplain Thursfield. I took them to Minnies Grave, and although th
2 CONC ere was no vacant space on either side there was room for 3 graves in front, but on consultin
2 CONC g the register it was found two of them were secured by right to relatives of the adjoining g
2 CONC raves. Eventually after scanning plans and sided by the memory of the Native Curator, we foun
2 CONC d we could get the plot almost in front of Minnie's, and without any intervening grave. The C
2 CONC urator then asked who the grave was for, and on being told Dr Pedley, the poor man burst int
2 CONC o tears, and said he had known him for over 20 years. All Saturday morning was spent answerin
2 CONC g verbal and telephone enquiries, etc., I had phoned on Friday night to the officer commandin
2 CONC g the Port Defence Force, and their Adjutant came to see me in the morning and said they hope
2 CONC d to arrange a Military Funeral and he would try to get the Royal Scots to provide a Band an
2 CONC d Firing party. He did his best but at 4 p.m.  had to let me know it could not be managed a
2 CONC s it being Saturday afternoon the Volunteers could not be so hurriedly got together, ad the R
2 CONC oyal Scots unfortunately where booked elsewhere. The St. John Ambulance Brigade asked if the
2 CONC y might attend in uniform and be allowed to carry the coffin from the cemetery gates to the g
2 CONC rave, and this was  readily granted, and I told them I knew their section would be appreciate
2 CONC d by Dr Pedley's relatives. Knowing that Minnie, Ray, Charles and Jack were all Church of Eng
2 CONC land, I asked Chaplain Thursfield to take the Service, but said I would appreciate it, an
2 CONC d I believed you all would too, if the Revd. Drysdale  was allowed to take some part as he wa
2 CONC s such a close personal friend of the Doctor. The Chaplain said he felt sure this could be ar
2 CONC ranged. Later the Bishop 'phoned saying he was most anxious to pay his respect himself, and b
2 CONC e allowed to pronounce the Benediction and he said he fully approved of Mr Drysdale reading t
2 CONC he Lesson. So far as could be done, notice of the funeral was circulate generally throughou
2 CONC t the town, but indeed it scarcely needed this as the news had spread to most quarters on Fri
2 CONC day night. Troops of friends of all races came to Bridge  House all day Saturday and were all
2 CONC owed to see the body, but about 1 p.m. after I had, in company with Mr Drysdale see the corps
2 CONC e, carefully and reverently placed in the coffin, we both thought it wiser to have it closed
2 CONC . Beautiful Wreaths kept coming in all day from all sorts of people and people themselves con
2 CONC tinued coming all afternoon, both European and Eurasian as well as members of Burmese and oth
2 CONC er races.
